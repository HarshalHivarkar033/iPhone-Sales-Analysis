This project presents an in-depth analysis of iPhone sales data from Flipkart India using Python with Pandas and NumPy for data analysis and Plotly for interactive visualizations. The dataset (apple_products.csv) was explored to check for missing values, perform descriptive analysis, and extract meaningful insights. The study highlights the top 10 highest-rated iPhones on Flipkart, examines the number of ratings and reviews for these models, and identifies the iPhone with the highest number of reviews. Additionally, it investigates the relationship between sale price, customer ratings, and reviews to understand consumer behavior and product performance. Interactive bar charts and trend visualizations created with Plotly make the insights easy to interpret. This project serves as a valuable resource for understanding customer preferences, sales trends, and the overall performance of iPhone models in the Indian e-commerce market.
